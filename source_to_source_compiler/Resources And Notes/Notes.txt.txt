Definition
A source-to-source translator, source-to-source compiler (S2S compiler), transcompiler, or transpiler[1][2][3] is a type of translator that takes the source code of a program written in a programming language as its input and produces an equivalent source code in the same or a different programming language.

code refactoring
In computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing source code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its non-functional attributes), while preserving its functionality.
